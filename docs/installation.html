<h1>Asterisk CDR Statistics</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><em>This document is under construction.</em></p>

<h3>Unpacking and basic setup.</h3>

<p>You're reading this so you've already unpacked the compressed archive. Now move
the contents to wherever you want them to be and issue the following commands from
the root of the package:</p>

<pre class="code">chmod 777 data/templates_c data/cache
</pre>

<h3>Apache server configuration</h3>

<p>AGCDR requires a separate virtual host. The following virtual host configuration
is suitable. Change "*:port" to whichever IP address and port number you wish to use
and change "/path/to/public/dir" to point to the "public" sub-directory of the
un-packed application.</p>

<pre class="code">&lt;VirtualHost *:port&gt;

        DocumentRoot /path/to/public/dir

        &lt;Directory /path/to/public/dir/>
                Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
                AllowOverride All
                Order deny,allow
                allow from all
        &lt;/Directory&gt;

	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/images/
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/libraries/
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/css
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/js
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/Favicon.ico
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?route=$1

        ErrorLog /path/to/error.log
        LogLevel debug
        CustomLog /path/to/access.log combined

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

<p>Given that this software exposes potentially sensitive information regarding
the usage of your PBX you will most likely wish to lock down your virtual host
by IP or by using HTTP auth. AGCDR has no authentication or access control methods
of its own.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>All configuration is done in application/config.php. Edit this file and change
the following as a minimum:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Change the "LIVE_URL" constant to match the virtual host under which
	you have installed AGCDR.</li>
	<li>Add the details of at least one database server which hosts the CDR
	data generated by the cdr_mysql Asterisk module. Complete the fields as
	shown in the demonstration.</li>
</ol>
