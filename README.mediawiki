==Introduction==

Asterisk CDR Statistics (AGCDR) is a PHP application designed to work with data generated by the Asterisk MySQL CDR add-on. It produces periodical reports on the usage of your Asterisk PBX and uses Google Charts to produce dynamic visualisations of call volumes. AGCDR supports multiple database servers allowing you to monitor all the Asterisk servers for which you are responsible from one installation of AGCDR.

==Principal features==

* Clean, modern interface.
* Supports multiple Asterisk servers which record their CDRs to a MySQL database.
* Uses Google Chart API to generate dynamic charts.
* Quick and advanced search facilities.
* Rolling monthly and annual reports.
* MVC framework.

==Development==

Where does it go from here? I'm open to suggestion, which is why I've published it and I would welcome comments from anyone who's interested and/or finds it useful, whether you are a developer or just an end user. Is it useful? Does it work out of the box on your system? Is it easy to install for someone who isn't a developer? What other features would be useful, bearing in mind that the data produced by the Asterisk CDR MySQL add-on is relatively limited?

I know that the documentation is a little rough around the edges and so I shall be paying attention to that, certainly. I also want to do some really thorough and structured testing in order to ensure it's as robust as possible. I've tested it, obviously, but I've not seriously tried to break it yet.

Please submit any comments, suggestions or indeed any code you would like to contribute via the Github page in order that all information pertaining to it is kept in the same place.

See the issues section for full details of planned and completed enhancements and amendments.
