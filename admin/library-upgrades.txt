Notes when upgrading third party libraries
------------------------------------------

1) There is a custom plugin that must be transferred when upgrading Smarty:
   <smarty>/libs/plugins/function.icon.php

2) There is a lot of unnecessary guff that comes with the third party libraries
   They can be thinned down to a great extent using these commands (you may
   need to update the version numbers in the paths accordingly):

	cd <working directory>
	svn rm  application/libraries/adodb5/docs \
		application/libraries/Smarty-2.6.26/demo \
		public/libraries/DataTables-1.7.5/examples \
		public/libraries/jquery-ui-1.8.7.custom/development-bundle \
		public/libraries/DataTables-1.7.5/media/unit_testing/
	svn commit -m "Thinning down third party libraries."
